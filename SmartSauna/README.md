# SmartSauna
First year IT application study project.

## Project goals
Design and build a system that monitors its environment with sensors and controls devices attached to a microcontroller.

## Our project
Working with two of my class mates, we designed and developed a sensor system around an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, that is used for measuring the environment of a sauna.
It incorporates various sensors for measuring temperatures, humidity and door opening frequencies.

Two DHT22 -sensors were used to monitor the temperature and humidity levels both inside the sauna and outdoors.

A MAX6675 -thermocouple sensor was placed inside the chimney to get the temperature of the stove.

Two Reed switches were used to monitor the usage of two doors leading in to the sauna room.

## Software and cloud
The code for the Arduino Nano microcontroller was written in C using Arduino IDE and Arduino WebEditor.
The data was transmitted into Arduino Cloud using the built-in wifi of the Nano board.
